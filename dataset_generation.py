"""
I have developed a code that generates synthetic data specifically designed for Tableau, 
enabling the creation of a dashboard intended for publication on Tableau Public.

The motivation behind crafting this data was twofold. Firstly, it offers flexibility in selecting the columns to utilize, 
and secondly, it addresses the challenge of locating similar data readily available on the internet.

This code is adept at simulating fictitious data that closely resembles real-life scenarios, 
thanks to its integration of random variables based on mathematical principles. The code's key steps can be summarized as follows:

1. **Initialization:** This phase involves creating lists for salespeople, managers, stores, regions, and other essential variables.

2. **Assignment:** Salespeople are assigned to managers, stores, and regions as part of this step.

3. **Account Association:** Accounts are linked to salespeople, facilitating a comprehensive data representation.

4. **Determination and Adjustment of Opportunities:** Leveraging a Poisson distribution and 
fine-tuning to approach the target of around 1000 opportunities.

5. **Opportunity Generation:** Opportunities are generated for each account, taking into account predefined weights.

6. **Calculation of Actual Prices:** This step involves applying a variability factor and considering the likelihood of success.

7. **DataFrame Creation and Verification:** The generated data is integrated into a DataFrame while ensuring data consistency 
and coherence.

8. **Incorporating Growth Factors and Seasonality:** The code defines and applies annual growth factors and seasonality patterns.

9. **Monthly Goals:** It generates monthly targets for each salesperson, facilitating performance tracking.

10. **DataFrame for Goals:** This phase involves the integration of monthly goals into a separate DataFrame.

11. **Export and Download of DataFrames:** Finally, the code writes the "opportunities" and "goals" DataFrames 
to an Excel file and retrieves the resulting file.

This comprehensive code streamlines the process of generating synthetic data tailored for Tableau, ensuring that the subsequent dashboard creation and publication on Tableau Public are efficient and effective."""
